# Production Baseline

Observed on 2026-07-16 before the Airflow 3 migration.

## Approved Cutover Scope

On 2026-07-17 the migration scope changed to a fresh Airflow 3 metadata
database. Historical Airflow 2 metadata is not required. The old database and
its encrypted backup remain intact for rollback, while contract-declared
configuration, venue deduplication caches, and proxy caches move to the new
system. Fallback outboxes remain incident evidence and are reset without
replay.

The isolated empty-database and configuration-import procedure passed on
2026-07-17. See
[`fresh-start-rehearsal-2026-07-17.md`](fresh-start-rehearsal-2026-07-17.md).

## Latest Read-only Refresh

The health check at 2026-07-17 11:00 Asia/Shanghai still found Airflow 2.10.5
at commit `2e74766256c97ff0af00f70b0af6ebb2777abe3e`. The metadata database had
grown to 42,475,056,275 bytes, with 16,659,836,928 bytes free on reliable root
storage. All venue, proxy, and cleanup DAGs had three recent successful runs;
the phone reboot DAG showed `success`, `failed`, `failed`.

The remaining gates were unchanged: two stale Appium import errors, missing
`VENUE_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `VENUE_EMAIL_REPLY_TO`, an invalid or absent
pinned Zacks host-key fingerprint, an unreachable managed WeChat sender, and
fallback outbox counts of 36 email and 200 WeChat incident records. These
records must not be replayed automatically.

## Runtime

| Component | Observed state |
| --- | --- |
| Git commit | `2e74766256c97ff0af00f70b0af6ebb2777abe3e` |
| Airflow | 2.10.5 |
| Python | 3.12.10 |
| Executor | CeleryExecutor |
| Airflow image | `bitnami/airflow:2.10.5` |
| PostgreSQL | 17 |
| Redis | 8.6.0 image line |
| Host memory | 7.5 GiB, no swap |
| Root filesystem | 79 GiB, 15.8 GiB free |
| Secondary filesystem | 99 GiB, unusable due to ext4 I/O errors |

The production repository had one unrelated untracked `nohup.out` file. It must
not be committed or removed as part of the migration without establishing
ownership.

The filesystem mounted at `/root/data/disk` repeatedly returned ext4 inode and
directory read errors. It must not be used for backups or migration rehearsal
until the host filesystem is repaired outside this project.

## Migration Backup

An encrypted, consistent custom-format PostgreSQL backup was streamed directly
from the production container to the operator workstation:

- completed: `2026-07-16T15:48:54Z`
- encrypted size: approximately 2.0 GiB
- encryption: AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2; key stored outside the repository
- SHA-256 checksum: verified
- `pg_restore --list`: recognized a PostgreSQL custom archive with 368 TOC
  entries and gzip compression

The exported Airflow Variables, Connections, and Pools configuration is also
encrypted and stored outside the repository. Backup filenames and keys are not
committed. The full historical migration rehearsal completed on 2026-07-17 and
remains evidence, but it is no longer the production deployment path. See
[`migration-rehearsal-2026-07-17.md`](migration-rehearsal-2026-07-17.md).

## Metadata Database

| Metric | Observed value |
| --- | ---: |
| Database size | 42,469,788,819 bytes |
| DAG runs | 2,906,144 |
| Task instances | 11,928,578 |
| XCom rows | 3,737,203 |

Core relation sizes from the read-only health check:

| Relation | Total size |
| --- | ---: |
| `task_instance` | 18,384,207,872 bytes |
| `log` | 14,536,491,008 bytes |
| `dag_run` | 2,464,915,456 bytes |
| `xcom` | 1,636,204,544 bytes |

Only 16,957,681,664 bytes were free on the root filesystem. This prevents the
historical in-place migration, but the approved fresh-start path does not
rewrite or copy the 42 GB database. The old database remains in place and the
new runtime must retain the minimum free-space floor in
`config/runtime-target.yaml`.

The high row count is caused by sub-minute venue schedules combined with a
180-day retention window. It materially increases backup and major-version
migration time. Production retention changes require a backup and explicit
approval because deletion is irreversible.

## Parsed DAGs

Nine DAGs were present in the current DagBag and all were unpaused:

- `airflow_db_cleanup`
- `HTTPS可用代理巡检`
- `HTTPS可用代理巡检_ydmap`
- `TOPS科技园网球场巡检`
- `zacks_phone_daily_reboot`
- `上越沙河网球场巡检`
- `深圳市体育中心网球场巡检`
- `深圳湾网球场巡检`
- `深圳金地网球场巡检`

The five venue DAGs and two proxy DAGs had successful recent runs. The phone
reboot DAG had two recent failures in `resolve_zacks_device_config`; its
Variable shape was present and structurally valid, so the remaining failure is
an external device or SSH/ADB runtime concern.

## Import Errors

The production CLI reported persistent Appium import errors:

- `dags/tennis_dags/wx_msg_watcher_for_zacks.py`
- `dags/utils/appium/wx_appium.py`

The Appium message watcher remains as stale metadata in `DagModel` but is not in
the parsed DagBag. Current venue notification code uses the remote WeChat sender
API instead. This is evidence for removal after the final reference audit.

A full unsafe DagBag scan also imported utility files directly and exposed
missing optional dependencies in non-DAG modules. The Airflow 3 layout must keep
reusable code outside the DAG scan root and install only dependencies needed by
active components.

## Configuration Inventory

Production had no Airflow Connections and only the default Pool. Variable names
are recorded in `config/active-components.yaml`; values are intentionally not
documented.

## External Services

- Public venue booking APIs
- Public proxy source repositories
- GitHub Contents API for proxy list publication
- Tencent SES
- Remote WeChat sender HTTP API
- SSH/ADB Android device host

No additional repository-managed systemd services or Docker services were
observed on this host outside the Airflow Compose stack.

The WeChat sender port had no listener and no persistent service manager.
Read-only fallback aggregation showed 200 WeChat records, all classified as
connection unavailable. Email had 36 records, all classified as provider
frequency or quota limits. Payloads, recipients, endpoints, and credentials
were not inspected or recorded. These outboxes are incident records and must
not be replayed blindly.

## Fresh-start Gates

Before production cutover:

1. Preserve the Airflow 2 database, runtime environment, commit, and images.
2. Produce a final protected configuration export.
3. Prepare the contract-filtered import with no missing required names.
4. Prove all active DAGs import with zero errors.
5. Run no-delivery contract and smoke tests.
6. Verify the new paths and free-space floor.
7. Prepare and verify path-switch rollback commands.
8. Start DAGs paused, import and verify configuration, then activate them.
