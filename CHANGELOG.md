# Changelog

This project follows Semantic Versioning. Entries describe user-visible runtime
and operational changes.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Migrate the target runtime from Airflow 2.10.5 to Airflow 3.3.0.
- Use the official Airflow image, API Server architecture, Standard Provider
  operators, Task SDK authoring API, CeleryExecutor, and FAB Auth Manager.
- Move notification and Android-host clients from the DAG scan path into the
  installable `wechat_airflow` package.
- Move venue, proxy refresh, and device maintenance implementations into the
  installable package, leaving production DAG files as schedule-and-wiring wrappers.
- Verify active DAG source files and task IDs against the machine-readable
  manifest, and include the Airflow 3 DagBag check in `make verify`.
- Keep venue recipient lists independent and make email and WeChat failure
  outboxes explicit.
- Add Agent-Native manifests, deterministic verification commands, production
  health checks, migration runbooks, and CI.
- Run the synchronous WeChat sender as an independent, pinned, non-root
  Compose service with automatic restart and health checks.
- Add metadata relation sizes, disk headroom, and managed-service status to the
  read-only production health gate.
- Pin Android-host SSH keys by SHA-256 fingerprint and disable legacy
  `ssh-rsa` SHA-1 negotiation.

### Removed

- Retired DAGs, archived experiments, duplicate utilities, legacy direct Appium
  notification code, Cloudflare sender gateway code, and unrelated SCF, Dify,
  Nginx, and database scripts that were not part of the production DagBag.
